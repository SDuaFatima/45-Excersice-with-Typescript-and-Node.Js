Learning TypeScript and working through 45 exercises to enhance my skills. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types,which can help catch errors early during development and improve overall code quality. It supports modern JavaScript features, including classes, interfaces,and modules, making it a powerful tool for building scalable and maintainable applications. Through these exercises, I aim to deepen my understanding of TypeScript's features and best practices, ultimately becoming more proficient in this versatile language.
